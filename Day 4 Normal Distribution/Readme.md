# Normal Distribution Plot (Constant Standard Deviation)

This Python script generates plots of normal distributions with varying means while keeping the standard deviation constant. The script utilizes NumPy and Matplotlib to visualize the probability density functions of these distributions.

## Description

The script defines three normal distributions with a constant standard deviation (σ) and varying means (μ). It then plots these distributions to demonstrate how changes in the mean affect the shape and location of the normal curve.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python normal_distribution_plot.py
   ```
3. The script will generate a plot displaying normal distributions with different means and a constant standard deviation.

## Plot Description

- **Yellow Curve**: Normal distribution with mean (μ) = 1 and standard deviation (σ) = 1.
- **Blue Curve**: Normal distribution with mean (μ) = 2 and standard deviation (σ) = 1.
- **Purple Curve**: Normal distribution with mean (μ) = 3 and standard deviation (σ) = 1.

The x-axis represents the value, and the y-axis represents the probability density.
